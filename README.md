# Gait analysis 

Contains MATLAB code for  comparing different methods of estimating the maximum height of the body’s centre of mass during the vertical jump trial.
The methods to be compared are:
• Centre of mass of the lower body
• Kinematic method
• Modelling the body as a projectile
• Conservation of energy

Hip coordinates were found using  Davis Hip model
