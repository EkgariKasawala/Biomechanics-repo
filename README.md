# Gait analysis 

Contains MATLAB code for  comparing different methods of estimating the maximum height of the body’s centre of mass during a vertical jump trial.
The methods to be compared are:
• Centre of mass of the lower body
• Kinematic method
• Modelling the body as a projectile
• Conservation of energy

Data used was collected using Vicon motion capture system 
Force and trajectory data was use  to estimate Hip coordinates  using  Davis Hip model
